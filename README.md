## About The Project

Data modelling with Postgres for the first project submission on the Udacity 'Data Engineering' nano-degree.

The premise of the project is that a start-up called 'Sparkify' wants to analyse the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.

The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

### Built With

* Python, inc. pandas, psycopg2

* Postgres
* Jupyter Hub

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* psycopg2
* Postgres
* pandas

### Installation

1. To clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sama26/Project1-Million_Songs.git
   ```

## Usage

To use this code you will need to have locally saved copies of the test song data provided by Udacity:

###### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

###### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

##### Sample query

An example query that can be used on this dataset would be  the following, which returns a list of all paid users who have used the service, and their location:

   ```sh
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, s.location FROM songplays s
JOIN users u
ON u.user_id = s.user_id
WHERE s.level = 'paid'
GROUP BY u.first_name, u.last_name, s.location
   ```
